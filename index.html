<h1>The Best Movies According To Me</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Ravanan</h3>
<p>The reason why i liked thi movie so much is the beatiful way it is presented, based on the plot of the epic Ramayan here the Ravanan(Played by Vikram) is actually the one with a purpose and who is devoid of ego whereas Dev(similar character to Ram, Played by Prithviraj)is actually the one which represents the one with egoistic power.Theres a lot to tell about this movie but lets just limit it till here. Aishwarya Rai...just beautiful ...noting else to say, how beautifully she has played the role of Sita...absolutely beautiful. And the frames ...fantastic.AR Rahman and his music was just perfect, absolutely perfect and beautiful</p>
<h3>Ponniyin Selvan</h3>
<p>Adithya Karikalan and Nandini part really was the only reason i watched the movie...because Vikram played it so well , maybe i liked these two character because they reminded me of Veerayya and Ragini from the  movie Ravanan .And the movie is branded by the name Mani Ratnam so it says it all, the best period film in Indian film industry without any doubt. and the name AR Rahman...no nee for any other description when you see this name </p>
<h3>Pazhassiraja</h3>
<p>Mammooty as Kerala Verma Pazhassi Raja , I have nothing to say ,the way that man played that character... for me this became like the manifestation of what we actually mean by a "KING", absolutely fantastic work done by Mammooty, and the bgm was also pretty good</p>
